Refreshing Your UI with HTML5, Bootstrap and CSS3
=======================================================================
I am giving this presentation to the [HTML5 Denver Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Denver-Users-Group/events/93212272/) on April 22, 2013.

About This Presentation
=======================================================================

Many startups and open source projects have the luxury of starting greenfield projects. Unfortunately, the corporate world rarely works this way. It's more maintenance coding and a few new features every now and then.  This session covers how you can use three of the hottest technologies (HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap) to spruce up a legacy application. It describes a real-world situation where a redesign was implemented in a few short weeks, making an old site look brand new. It also does a deep dive into Bootstrap, explains LESS, and shows pitfalls with older browsers. After this session, you'll be motivated to integrate Bootstrap into your applications and turn that legacy UI into something sexy!
